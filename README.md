# Super-Lang
Super is kind of a toy language made in java using only functions, not parsers,lexers or tokens so you can write it directly in the editor and it also makes it easy for me to make because its only functions but the con is that all of the "Keywords" have to be written after importing like "sup.$print('hello");".
