# About
Super is a set of functions designed to make java a bit easier.
Note that I am focusing mostly on VShell, so this won't be frequently developed
# Imports
1. Super.func - Imports the main toy "language"
2. Super.func.math - Imports the math functions
3. Super.func.input - Import input-output
4. Super.func.set - Imports sets *basically arrays*
5. Super.func.map - Imports maps *basically hashmaps*
6. Super.func.calender - Imports calender
7. Super.time - Imports time
8. Super.gui - Imports gui
9. Super.console - Imports more mays to edit the console output
10. Super.external - Imports functions that interact outside the console
11. Super.autoMake - Imports pre-made games as functions
12. Super.files - Imports a file reader and writer (Note - this import automatically creates a text file, you can change the file name and extension in the source code)
# How to use
If you are using it inside the package -
Make a object of the class you want to use like - func main = new func(); or math math = new math();
Use the functions like - main.$print("Hello"); or math.abs(10);
If you are using it outside the package -
Only one thing changes, that you have to import the super package's class instead of straight off making a object of it
# Tip
If you want to understand this deeper then I recommend reading the code
