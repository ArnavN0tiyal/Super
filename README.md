# About
Super lang is a toy language made with only functions, no parsers or lexers. More about it is in the description, for now here are some imports in this toy "language" and how to use it.
# Imports
1. Super.func - Imports the main toy "language"
2. Super.func.math - Imports the math functions
3. Super.func.input - Import input-output
4. Super.func.set - Imports sets *basically arrays*
5. Super.func.map - Imports maps *basically hashmaps*
6. Super.func.calender - Imports calender
7. Super.time - Imports time
8. Super.gui - Imports gui
9. Super.console - Imports more mays to edit the console output
10. Super.external - Imports functions that interact outside the console
11. Super.autoMake - Imports pre-made games as functions
12. Super.files - Imports a file reader and writer (Note - this import automatically creates a text file, you can change the file name and extension in the source code)
# How to use
Make a object of the import you want to use like - Super.func main = new func(); or Super.math math = new math();
Use the functions like - main.$print("Hello"); or math.abs(10);
# Tip
1. If you want to understand this deeper then I recommend reading the code
2. I recommend extending files instead of importing
3. Put your files inside the package for it to work
